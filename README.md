🤖 HandBot-CV – Computer Vision Controlled Robotic Hand

📌 Project Overview

HandBot-CV is a computer vision-based robotic hand that mimics human finger movements in real time.
Using OpenCV with Python, the system detects and tracks hand movements, processes them, and controls a robotic hand built with Arduino, servo motors, and 3D-printed components.

The project demonstrates the integration of computer vision, robotics, and mechanical design to create a precise and flexible robotic control system.
